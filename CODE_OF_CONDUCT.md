# 🌟 Repopack Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct 🌟

## 🙌 Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and community a **harassment-free experience** for everyone—regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. 🌈

## 🌟 Our Standards

Examples of **positive behavior** that contribute to creating a welcoming environment include:

- 🗣️ Using welcoming and inclusive language
- 🤝 Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- 🙏 Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- 🌍 Focusing on what is best for the community
- 💖 Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of **unacceptable behavior** by participants include:

- ❌ The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- 💥 Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- 🚫 Public or private harassment
- 🔒 Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- ⚠️ Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## ⚖️ Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for **clarifying standards of acceptable behavior** and are expected to take **appropriate and fair corrective action** in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are **not aligned** with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## 🌐 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both **within project spaces** and **in public spaces** when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## 🚨 Enforcement

Instances of **abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior** may be reported by contacting the project team at <a href="mailto:koukun0120@gmail.com" style="background-color:#ff6347;color:white;padding:10px 20px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;display:inline-block;border-radius:5px;">📧 Report an Incident</a>. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain **confidentiality** regarding the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
